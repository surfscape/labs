            <h2>Study Details</h2>
            <p>A web portal made for website templates, layouts, icons, and more web design resources and tools made by SurfScape but also by the community for Neocities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eversoul was a personal website on January of 2023 which then <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230223081901/https://eversoul.neocities.org/">became a web portal</a> of the same name that had both a community and a personal side. Eversoul closed down on April of 2023 to become NetFind (older version of SurfScape). Here is an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230530021411/https://surfscape.neocities.org/">archive of NetFind</a> when the branding was being changed to SurfScape.</p>
<h2>Implementation &amp; Design</h2>
<p>Eversoul will have a similar design to it's older web portal counter part, with a light purple as a primary color and a white background for content. The homepage would feature a grid with new templates, layouts, and other downloadable content of the same realm.</p>
<p>Every main category would have tags that are shared with all categories meaning the category <code>layouts</code> can have the tag <code>90's</code> and that tag would be the same for the category <code>buttons</code>, then the <code>90's</code> tag would show both the button and the layout with that tag.</p>
<p>The main categories will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layouts (css layouts) - barebones layouts for a quick site base.</li>
<li>Templates (html templates) - similar to layouts but with a pre-made design, more features, and some even customizables.</li>
<li>buttons (web 1.0 buttons) - a library of (mostly 88x31) gif and png buttons.</li>
<li>icons (web 2.0 icons) - similar to buttons but for icons in different sizes (16x16, 32x32, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Eversoul will probably use a group of small <code>.json</code> files to create it's database since it will be a static website.</p>
<p>Users would be able to add content trough GitHub issues or PRs.</p>
