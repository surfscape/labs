            <h2>Study Details</h2>
            <p>SurfKit is the next big project of SurfScape. It's a complete, modular, UI framework with it's own design language inspired by the 2000's web. It's similar to how bootstrap works but simpler, and unbiased.</p>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>Several versions have been published on both <a href="https://github.com/surfscape/surfkit/releases">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/surfkit">npm</a> for testing and feedback purposes but most importantly, to use on development versions of the new upcoming SurfScape web portal.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>This idea has turned to be pretty difficult because lack of resources and time. It's very hard to build a whole framework that as of now only works with dev SurfScape in a specific way. However there's an idea to restructure the project to only be used in the web portal itself and then share some componets to other sites and services that need them.</p>
