- Browser (user agent)
- Location (Country and Region, ex: Germany, Portugal, etc.)
- System (Windows, Android, etc.)
- Size (resolution of the display)

#### Use of Information

This data is used to know what are the most viewed/used studies, to check for bugs on specific browsers or systems, to optimize our services to specific displays, and improve our services.

#### Data Retention

This data is is kept forever until we don't need it anymore or if someone requests a deletion of that data trough [SurfScape's Privacy Portal](https://surfscape.neocities.org/privacy).
