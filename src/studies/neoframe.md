**Update:** The project has been renamed to Neoframe.

A web portal made for website templates, layouts, icons, and more web design resources and tools made by SurfScape but also by the community for Neocities.

## History

Eversoul was a personal website on January of 2023 which then [became a web portal](http://web.archive.org/web/20230223081901/https://eversoul.neocities.org/) of the same name that had both a community and a personal side. Eversoul closed down on April of 2023 to become NetFind (older version of SurfScape). Here is an [archive of NetFind](http://web.archive.org/web/20230530021411/https://surfscape.neocities.org/) when the branding was being changed to SurfScape.

## Implementation & Design

Eversoul will have a similar design to it's older web portal counter part, with a light purple as a primary color and a white background for content. The homepage would feature a grid with new templates, layouts, and other downloadable content of the same realm.

Every main category would have tags that are shared with all categories meaning the category `layouts` can have the tag `90's` and that tag would be the same for the category `buttons`, then the `90's` tag would show both the button and the layout with that tag.

The main categories will be:

- Layouts (css layouts) - barebones layouts for a quick site base.
- Templates (html templates) - similar to layouts but with a pre-made design, more features, and some even customizables.
- buttons (web 1.0 buttons) - a library of (mostly 88x31) gif and png buttons.
- icons (web 2.0 icons) - similar to buttons but for icons in different sizes (16x16, 32x32, etc).

Neoframe will probably use a group of small `.json` files to create it's database since it will be a static website.

Users would be able to add content trough GitHub issues or PRs.
